# Advent of Tamagui

## Setup

Initial setup of the project is covered in [Tamagui Setup](TAMAGUI_SETUP.md)

## Advent

Advent Project Solutions of:

- [CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/)
- [SVG](https://svg-tutorial.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023)

While some of these challenges might not exclusively be `Tamagui` related, I thought it would be fun to see how many of these challenges I could do consistently for the month, with the goal of:

- Universal Support
- Using as much of Tamagui as possible
- Using reanimated
- Fun, Joy and Cheer, and to all a happy new year!
